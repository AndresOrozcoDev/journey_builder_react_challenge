> [!TIP]

Due to the video's length and the fact that my YouTube account is not yet verified, I was unable to upload it to the platform.

## üß† Descripci√≥n

**Journey Builder** is an interactive application for visualizing and managing *prefill* relationships between forms within a wizard-like flow, represented as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.

This tool allows you to:

- View all forms and their fields.
- Automatically detect fields with prefill configured from another form.
- Configure or modify valid prefill relationships.
- Ensure that forms selectable as prefill sources are properly connected in the graph.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Graph Functionality

- Forms are represented as nodes (`nodes`) with connections (`edges`).
- Prefill relationships are only allowed from **antecesores** forms in the graph (not just any form).
- `graph.ts` contains key functions such as:
  - `getFormFieldsWithPrefill(graph)` ‚Üí returns the table of fields with possible prefill relationships.
  - `getUpstreamFormsWithFields(formId)` ‚Üí returns valid forms that can prefill the current one.
